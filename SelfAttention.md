Self Attention Line-by-line breakdown by ChatGPT 3.5

__init__() explanation
This code defines a class called SelfAttention that inherits from the nn.Module class. It is used to implement the self-attention mechanism. Let's go through the initialization:
    
    The __init__ method initializes the class instance with two attributes: num_heads and d_model. num_heads represents the number of attention heads, and d_model represents the dimensionality of the input and output vectors.

        It also initializes three linear layers: query, key, and value. These layers project the input into query, key, and value vectors for each attention head. Each linear layer takes an input of dimension d_model and produces an output of dimension d_model.

                ##What is a linear layer exactly?
                    Also known as a fully connected layer or a dense layer, it is a fundamental component of a nueral network
                    
                    Its function is to perform a linear transformation on the input data

                    output = input * weight^T + bias

                    In straightforward math terms, a linear layer outputs a dot product of our input data with a transposed weight matrix (those weights are learned through backpropagation and gradient descent) with a bias term added on for a small offset.

                ## what is a linear layer in this context? 
                    The linear layers above are used for the model to learn about what the words mean based on their context, the context being the positional information of every other word, along with additional data

                

            The scale attribute is set to 1.0 / math.sqrt(d_model). It is a scaling factor used in the attention calculation.
