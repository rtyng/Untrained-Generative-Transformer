The SelfAttention class is defined as a subclass of nn.Module.

The __init__ method initializes the class and takes d_model (dimension of the model) and num_heads (number of attention heads) as input parameters.

The num_heads and d_model values are assigned to instance variables for later use.
self.query, self.key, and self.value are linear layers used for projecting the input tensor into query, key, and value tensors, respectively. They are defined using nn.Linear, with the input and output dimensions set as d_model.

The self.scale variable is set to 1.0 / math.sqrt(d_model). It is used to scale the dot product of the query and key tensors in order to prevent the gradients from vanishing or exploding during the training process.

The forward method defines the forward pass of the SelfAttention module, taking the input tensor x as a parameter.
The batch_size variable is assigned the size of the first dimension of x, which represents the batch size.
The input tensor x is projected into query, key, and value tensors by passing it through the linear layers self.query, self.key, and self.value, respectively. This is done by calling the layers as functions with x as the input.

The query, key, and value tensors are reshaped to enable multi-head attention. This is achieved by using the view method to reshape the tensors. The reshaping is done to separate the heads of attention and enable parallel processing.

The attention scores are computed by taking the dot product of the query tensor q and the key tensor k, transposed along the last two dimensions using transpose(1, 2) to perform matrix multiplication. This is done using torch.matmul.
The computed scores are then scaled by the self.scale value, which helps stabilize the gradients during training.

The attention scores are passed through a softmax function using F.softmax to obtain attention probabilities. The dim=-1 argument specifies to apply the softmax operation along the last dimension.

The attention probabilities (attn_probs) are multiplied element-wise with the value tensor v using torch.matmul to apply attention weights to the value vectors.

The resulting attended output tensor (attn_output) is reshaped using view to combine the multi-head outputs back into a single tensor.
Finally, the reshaped tensor is returned as the output of the forward method.
