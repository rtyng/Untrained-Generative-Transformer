#__init__() description

This code defines a class called PositionalEncoding, which inherits from the nn.Module class, indicating that it is a PyTorch module. The purpose of this class is to generate positional encodings for sequences of a given d_model dimension.

The __init__ method is the constructor of the class. It initializes the class instance with two attributes: dropout and positional_encoding. 
    The dropout attribute is an instance of nn.Dropout with a dropout probability of 0.1 (i.e., 10%). 
        The positional_encoding attribute is initialized by calling the generate_encoding method, passing the d_model and max_len as arguments.

#generate_encoding()

The generate_encoding method creates the positional encoding for the given d_model and max_len values. Let's break it down:

It first initializes an encoding tensor of shape (max_len, d_model) filled with zeros.

    It creates a position tensor using torch.arange(0, max_len, dtype=torch.float). This tensor represents the position indices and has shape (max_len, 1).

        It calculates a div_term tensor by taking the exponential of a range tensor multiplied by a factor. The range tensor is obtained using torch.arange(0, d_model, 2).float(), representing [0, 2, 4, ..., d_model-2]. The factor used is (-math.log(10000.0) / d_model). The purpose of this calculation will become clear in a moment.

            The encoding tensor is modified in two steps:

            encoding[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(position * div_term): This assigns the sine values of position * div_term to every other column starting from the first column 
            (0-indexed).

            encoding[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(position * div_term): This assigns the cosine values of position * div_term to every other column starting from the second column.

            It reshapes the encoding tensor by unsqueezing the first dimension and transposing the dimensions using encoding.unsqueeze(0).transpose(0, 1). The resulting shape will be (max_len, 1, d_model), representing (sequence_length, batch_size, d_model).

Finally, it returns the encoded tensor.

The forward pass method is where the encoded information is passed onto the self attention mechanism
