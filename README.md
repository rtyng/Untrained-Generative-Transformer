# Untrained-Generative-Transformer

This is an attempt to build a "mini-GPT" for the purpose of machine translation from english to spanish. I was inspired by the 2017 research paper "Attention is all you need" where the transformer model architecture was introduced. ChatGPT is basically a highly trained and much more complex version of what was introduced in this paper (according to my current knowledge).
Right now I am currently adding in research notes about the model arcitecture. As notes are being added I plan to add in visualizations of each portion of the model as well as input and output data 
to better understand its functionality.
