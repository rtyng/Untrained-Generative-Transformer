# Untrained-Generative-Transformer
This is an attempt to build a "mini-GPT" for various purposes (for example, a philosophy bot or automatic chat bot that users can interact with eventually)
Right now I am currently adding in research notes about the model arcitecture. As notes are being added I plan to add in visualizations of each portion of the model as well as input and output data 
to better understand its functionality.
